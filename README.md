# This is a reuse and testing of the pybitcointools from vbuterin and Vitalik Buterin's(the original aouthor of this.)

Python Version this code was written in: Python 3.10.15

in this repo are couple of scripts that shows the actuall usage of that amazing library
Thanks to  vbuterin for creating that amazing library(i learned alot from it.)

The difference of this version is:
there are couple of scripts that print the results of that functions to the console.
Intention of this is to make it more accessable how all the 
Blockchain stuff actually work.

here are some workflows you can realize with that scripts:

1. savely create a transaction and singn it offline for dogecoin or bitcoin (works kind of the same)
- run  Create_Address_Doge.py

    Result is this:(print in terminal)

        ------------------------------------------------------------    
        Created doge address  Network: Mainnet(the real doge blockchain)
        ------------------------------------------------------------
        doge:Private Key:        baa778ce2b842c97da52ac37e6163a2514844a637b02afabd92f0922d4ec1e88
        doge:Public_address:     DNV2oGc6jnYV3uZXx33oNWEzvSiYy5sVox
        ------------------------------------------------------------
        test it: https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/address/1EfayE6j4nv6L13Q2BdDtys7Gs2b791ev4/
